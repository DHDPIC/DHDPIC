        <p><strong>Muesli</strong> is a cold breakfast dish, the primary ingredient of which is rolled oats, which is set to soak overnight and eaten the next morning. Most often, additional ingredients such as grains, nuts, seeds, and fresh or dried fruits, are added, along with milk or cream, a squeeze of citrus juice and, honey to add sweetness.[3] Yoghurt or other mammal or plant milk products are now commonly added to both homemade and commercially packaged muesli recipes.</p>
        
        <p>Developed around 1900 by Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital, it is now eaten as a standard breakfast dish, like a breakfast cereal, and in Switzerland also for supper as Birchermüesli complet, muesli with Café complet (milk coffee, accompanied by bread, butter and jam (Butterbrot)).</p>

        <p>In addition to being prepared raw, muesli can be toasted. Muesli can also be processed further by adding sweetener and oil to bind the ingredients together and baked to produce granola.</p>

        <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
        <p>Originally known in Swiss German as Birchermüesli after its creator Bircher-Benner or simply Müesli, the word is an Alemannic diminutive of Mues (non-Swiss Standard German: Mus) meaning "mush" or "purée".</p>

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <p>Muesli was not originally intended as a breakfast food, but as an appetiser similar to bread and butter. It was consumed as Schweizer Znacht (lit.: Swiss supper), but not as a breakfast cereal.
        </p>

        <p>It was introduced around 1900 by Bircher-Benner for patients in his hospital,[4] where a diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables was an essential part of therapy. It was inspired by a similar "strange dish" that he and his wife had been served on a hike in the Swiss Alps.</p>
            
        <p>Bircher-Benner himself referred to the dish simply as "d'Spys" (Swiss German for "the dish", in German "die Speise"); it was commonly known as Apfeldiätspeise (Apple Diet Meal). Bircher opened a chalet-style sanitorium on Zürichberg called Lebendige Kraft (lit.: lively power). These facilities had risen in popularity during the era of lebensreform, a social movement which valued health foods and vegetarianism.</p>

        <h2 id="recipes">Recipes</h2>
        <h3>Original Bircher-Benner recipe</h3>
        <p>The dish was prepared by mixing the cream and honey or condensed milk with the soaked oats and lemon juice and, while stirring, grating the whole apple into the mixture. This method prevented the apple pulp from browning. The intent was to serve the dish fresh, immediately before any other dishes in the meal.</p>

        <h3>Fresh muesli</h3>
        <p>Muesli traditionally is freshly prepared using dried rolled oats or whole grain oats that have been soaked in water or fruit juice.[14] Other common ingredients are grated or chopped fresh fruit (e.g., bananas, apples, berries, grapes, mango), dried fruit, milk products (e.g., fresh milk, yoghurt, cream, condensed milk, fromage frais, quark, cottage cheese, or nondairy milk substitutes), lemon juice, ground nuts, seeds, spices (especially cinnamon), honey and muesli mix.</p>

        <h3>Packaged muesli</h3>
        <p>Packaged muesli is a loose mixture of mainly rolled oats or cornflakes together with various dried fruit pieces, nuts, and seeds – the main ingredients of any muesli. It commonly contains other rolled cereal grains such as wheat or rye flakes.</p>
